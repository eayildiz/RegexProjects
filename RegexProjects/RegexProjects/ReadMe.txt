	I have run this code with "python3" command.
	
	This program parse the predetermined file and make a new file that just shows ip adress' and date or a number related to date. Predetermined files are "log_task1.txt" and "log_task2.txt".
	
	This codes will create "error_log.txt" and "error_log2.txt" for debugging and keep tracking of possible error purposes. If any unexpected output occured, I advise to check those files.
	There might be some explanation for wrong output.
	The expected error log file is empty file.
	The error file is rewriting on itself at every running that particular program.
